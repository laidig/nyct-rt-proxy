# NYC Subway RT shim

This program processes MTA Subway GTFS-RT feeds, converts them to standard GTFS-RT, and publishes a consolidated
TripUpdate feed at a new endpoint. If possible, TripUpdates from the RT feed are matched to static GTFS trips and 
RT IDs are replaced by matched static trip IDs.

### Usage

Build jar:

    mvn package

Get NYC Subway GTFS from MTA developer downloads (login through [mta.info/developers](http://web.mta.info/developers) 
and sign the agreement first):

    wget http://web.mta.info/developers/data/nyct/subway/google_transit.zip

Run the program:

    java -jar nyct-rt-proxy-1.0-SNAPSHOT-withAllDependencies.jar --config config.txt

### config example

Here is an example `config.txt`. Uncomment the `cloudwatch.*` values to send metrics to Cloudwatch (disabled otherwise):

    NYCT.gtfsPath=/path/to/google_transit.zip
    NYCT.key=
    tripUpdates.url=http://localhost:8001/tripUpdates
    #cloudwatch.namespace=
    #cloudwatch.accessKey=
    #cloudwatch.secretKey=
    
The following parameters are defaults, but can be overridden by adding to `config.txt`:

    NYCT.gtfsAgency=MTASBWY # if running with buses, override the agency/feed ids by modifying the input gtfs agency_id and adding this option.  Default MTA NYCT
    NYCT.feedIds=["1", "2", "11", "16", "21"]
    NYCT.routeBlacklistByFeed={"1": ["D", "N", "Q"]}
    NYCT.realtimeToStaticRouteMapByFeed={"1": {"S": "GS", "5X": "5"}}
    NYCT.addToTripReplacementPeriodByRoute={"6": "6X"}
    NYCT.latencyLimit=300  # ignore feed if its timestamp is more than 300s in the past
    NYCT.lateTripLimitSec=3600 # match RT trip to static trip with scheduled departure up to 3600s before RT trip
    NYCT.refreshRate=60
    NYCT.retryDelay=5

### Known issues

- There can be duplicate trip IDs in the published feed, because TripUpdates without an exact origin-departure time match are matched
to the closest static trip in the past. We cannot remove duplicates without adding state to the matching algorithm.
- StopTimeUpdates which do not correspond to stop times in the matched trip are removed. This means that if an express trip is running
local, local stops will not be propagated.

### Feed/route reference

See MTA's [list of feeds](http://datamine.mta.info/list-of-feeds).

|Feed ID|Routes|Notes|
|-------|------|-----|
|1|1,2,3,4,5,6,GS|May include a subway path identifier at the end of trip IDs.|
|2|L||
|11|SI||
|16|N,Q,R,W|Intermittent connections.|
|21|B,D|Southbound trips on D may be separated at mid-line relief points.|

The following conditions will be automatically fixed:

- Invalid `TripDescriptor.start_date` values (format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS rather than YYYYMMDD)
- Stop IDs missing direction of travel
